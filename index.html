            <p>Stardew Valley is a farm simulator indie game created and developed by ConcernedApe. In Stardew Valley, you start off living in Joja City, but after your grandfather dies and passes his farm down to you, you quit your big-city job and move to the small town of Stardew Valley. Once you are here, you meet the Mayor and various other NPCs who have unique dialogue and you are able to build relationships with them. The main point of the game is to progress your farm through mining, fighting, foraging, farming, and fishing. Additionally, you are able to decorate your farm to your liking.</p>
